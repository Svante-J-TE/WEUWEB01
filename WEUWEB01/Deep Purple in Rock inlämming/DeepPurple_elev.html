            <h2>The Band</h2>
            <p>Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. The band is considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as "the globe's loudest band", and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.</p>

        <h4>The album was the band's breakthrough album in Europe and peaked at No. 4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months (the band's prior MK I albums had been much better received in the United States and Canada than in their homeland). An accompanying single, "Black Night" reached No. 2. The album was supported by the successful In Rock World Tour, which lasted 15 months. The album has continued to attract critical praise as a key early example of the hard rock and heavy metal genres. In Rock was recorded at IBC Studios in London, with the first sessions in October, 1969. Recording was spaced out between gigs, which were needed to provide the band with income, and continued intermittently until April the following year. The band's US record company, Tetragrammaton declared bankruptcy in early 1970, meaning an uncertainty of the album being released in the US. Warner Bros subsequently bought out the Tetragrammaton contract.
